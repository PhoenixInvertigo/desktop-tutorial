Just some personal projects of mine :D

CoinTree is a program to count the combinations available for making change. It uses a tree to calculate combinations in which coin order matters.

UniqueCoinCombinations is the followup to that, which simply finds the number of unique combinations in which coin order does not matter.

UniqueCoinsOrdered is a better version of CoinTree, since making a tree hold all of the combinations caused memory issues. This version simply uses a recursive algorithm to iterate through combinations, adding each complete one to a counter.
